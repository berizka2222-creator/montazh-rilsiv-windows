# Reel editor

*Монтаж рілсів від [@inna_berezova](https://instagram.com/inna_berezova) (Інна Березова).*

Turns a raw talking-head clip into a finished, on-brand vertical reel. Every brand choice (colours, fonts, caption style, sounds, CTA) comes from the person's **brand file**, never from defaults baked into this skill. You do the editing; they only make the calls that are theirs.

## Before anything else: is there a brand file?

The workspace is `~/reels/` unless `REELS_HOME` is set.

- **No `~/reels/brand.md`** → run the setup interview: read `references/setup-uk.md` first (design system + reference reels are required before the first edit), then `references/setup-interview.md`. Do not edit a clip without a brand file, even if they say "just use whatever". The interview takes 5 minutes and it is the whole point of this skill.
- **Brand file exists** → read `brand.md` and `brand.json` in full, then continue.

## This is the Windows version
Everything runs in Claude Code's shell on Windows, which is Git Bash. Three rules for every command in this skill:
- `python3` on Windows is often a Microsoft Store stub that does nothing. Wherever this skill says `python3 scripts/x.py`, run `python scripts/x.py` (or `py scripts/x.py` if only the launcher exists). The `.sh` scripts find the right Python themselves.
- Put `PYTHONUTF8=1` in front of any Python you run by hand (the scripts switch it on themselves): brand files and captions are Cyrillic.
- `~` is the person's user folder (`C:\Users\<name>`). The finished reels go to `~/Videos/Reels` (Відео → Reels).

## First run on a new computer (do it yourself, never send the person to a terminal)
The person works in the Claude desktop app, Code tab. Never ask them to open PowerShell, CMD or a terminal. Windows asks «Дозволити цій програмі вносити зміни?» for some installs: tell them to click «Так». In this order, skipping what is already there:
1. Python: if `python -c "import sys"` fails (and `py -c "import sys"` too), run `winget install -e --id Python.Python.3.12 --scope user --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements`.
2. Node.js: if `node -v` fails, `winget install -e --id OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements` (the «Так» window appears).
3. ffmpeg: if `ffmpeg -version` fails, `winget install -e --id Gyan.FFmpeg --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements`.
4. A new install isn't on this shell's PATH yet. Append these lines to `~/.bashrc` (once) and also `export` them in every command until the app restarts:
   `export PATH="$LOCALAPPDATA/Programs/Python/Python312:$LOCALAPPDATA/Programs/Python/Python312/Scripts:/c/Program Files/nodejs:$LOCALAPPDATA/Microsoft/WinGet/Links:$PATH"` and `export PYTHONUTF8=1`. Then re-check `python`, `node`, `ffmpeg`. If one is still missing, find its .exe under `C:\Program Files` or `$LOCALAPPDATA` and add that folder.
   If `winget` itself is missing (old Windows 10), say so plainly and send them to the Microsoft Store page «App Installer» to update it, then continue.
5. `npx skills add heygen-com/hyperframes -y` if the HyperFrames skills are missing.
6. `bash scripts/setup_engine.sh` (animation library + sound effects).
7. Speech recognition: connect ElevenLabs Scribe (section «Connecting ElevenLabs Scribe» below). It is required: there is no local recogniser, so nothing large is downloaded. Walk them through creating the key in one short step at a time.
8. `mkdir -p ~/reels/fonts ~/reels/assets` (the reels workspace).
9. `bash scripts/doctor.sh`. If it's READY, tell them in one sentence that everything is ready, that it's worth closing and reopening the Claude app once (so the new programs are found), and that next time they open the Code tab with the folder `reels` and write «змонтуй рілс».
Explain each step in one short Ukrainian sentence: the person is a beginner.

## Check the tools (once per machine)

`bash scripts/doctor.sh` - checks ffmpeg, Node, the HyperFrames skills and (if the brand file says CapCut) the CapCut connector. Fix anything it flags before editing. Install steps are in the repo README.

## The edit, in order

Each reel gets its own folder: `~/reels/<yyyy-mm-dd>-<short-name>/`. Copy the raw clip in (never edit the original).

1. **Transcribe** - `python3 scripts/transcribe.py <clip> transcript.json`. Uses ElevenLabs Scribe with `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` from `~/.config/reels/.env` (tight word timing; it writes "ем"/"um" as words, which is how fillers are found). There is no local fallback: exit code 2 = no key (connect it), 1 = key, balance or network problem (say which, then retry).
2. **Clean the voice** - `bash scripts/clean_audio.sh <clip> voice.wav` (add `--denoise` if there is background noise). Targets -14 LUFS, the level Instagram and TikTok expect.
3. **Review (their call)** - propose: lines to cut (repeats, false starts, rambles), fillers to drop, CTA moved to the end, target under 60 s, and the graphics plan. **Wait for their yes before cutting.** This is the step people care most about.
   **Look at the start and end before proposing cuts:** grab a frame every 0.5 s for the first and last 4 s. Cut any camera setup (pointing at the floor/garden, flipping the camera, reaching for the phone) even if words are spoken over it. Start on the first frame where they're settled in shot, and on a word that works as an opener.
   - **Main path: the Reel Review page.** ALWAYS run a tool search for `Artifact` and `ArtifactData` first (they are usually deferred and only appear after the search). Never decide they are missing without searching. If they do, follow `references/review.md`: they tap words to cut, watch the live rough cut, check graphics, captions, sound and colour, then say "build preview". Its import step writes `edl.json` + `edit.json`, so skip to step 4's cut and step 5.4's render.
   - **Several clips at once (3-5):** one page with a reel picker and a render queue (`scripts/render_queue.py`): prepare reel 1 first and send the link, prepare the rest while they review, renders queue one at a time. See «Several reels at once» in `references/review.md`.
   - **Fallback: review in chat** only when the search found no such tools. Say so in one line first: «Сторінку перевірки відкрити не можу: в цій сесії немає інструментів Artifact/ArtifactData, тому перевіряємо в чаті». Show the transcript as numbered lines (format in `references/rough-cut.md`), then the card list in step 5.
4. **Tighten, then cut + speed** - write `edl.json` from the approved lines, then `python3 scripts/tighten.py <folder>`: it removes fillers and shortens pauses inside the kept lines, as hard as the brand's `"pacing"` says (`natural` default, `tight`, `fast`; presets in `scripts/pacing.py`). They never approve these one by one. Then `python3 scripts/snap_joins.py <folder>` (moves every join into the nearest quiet gap: transcript times are never exact, and a cut on them clips words), then `python3 scripts/cut.py <folder>`. Speed comes from the same preset unless `brand.json` sets `"speed"`.
5. **Graphics + captions: fill the template, don't design.** You are the editor here, not the designer - the look is already built from the brand file.
   1. `python3 scripts/transcribe.py master.mp4 master_transcript.json`
   2. `python3 scripts/auto_edit.py <folder>` → drafts `edit.json` (captions in their caption mode, punch-ins)
   3. Edit `edit.json` yourself, in one pass: set `"accent": true` on the one key word per sentence, and add cards at the density `brand.json` `"graphics"` asks for: `minimal` about one every 8-12 s, `balanced` (default) every 4-6 s, `busy` every 2-4 s. A line with nothing to show gets no card; don't chart every number or screenshot every tool just to fill the gap. Card types and fields are in the header of `scripts/build_reel.py`; HyperFrames catalog motions (carousels, charts, counters, notifications, cursor, follow cards) are in `references/motions.md`. Every card must show what that exact line says.
      - **Hook title: always ASK the person for the exact hook text before adding the title card. Never write or pick it yourself, not even from the transcript.** Text they typed in the hook / CTA fields on the review page («Графіка») IS their approved text: `review_sync.py import` prints it as `HOOK (their text, use as is)` / `CTA (their text)`; use it word for word and don't ask again. The hook stays on screen at least 3.5 s. You may offer 2-3 options in their words if they ask for ideas, but the card goes in only with the text they approved. Layout: max ~10 characters per line, 2-3 lines (`"still / uploading / screenshots?"`), so it renders big. It's the only text with an outline.
      - **Carousel:** if `brand.json` has `"require_carousel": true`, every reel gets one (`motion` card, a `carousel-*` name, `images` from screenshots/their assets). If no line suits one, ask them; if they say no, set `"no_carousel_ok": true`.
      - **Screenshots:** for a tool or site they name that the line is about, run `bash scripts/screenshot.sh <url> shots/<name>.png`. Exit code 2 means the site blocked it: try the tool's marketing page, or ask them for a screenshot. Never use a blank one.
      - **Their own photos/videos come first.** They place them on the review page's «Накладення» tab (or drop files in the reel folder and say where) before you plan anything else; then your cards and motion go around them, never in the same moment and area (`review_sync.py overlays` lists them and flags CONFLICTs; two rounds, see `references/review.md`). Each becomes an `overlay` card (sizes small-r/small-l/big/full or a dragged `box`, effects soft/slide/polaroid/glass/zoom; header of `scripts/build_reel.py`).
      - **«За мною» (behind the person):** `"behind": true` on any card (text, sticker, photo, motion) puts it between the background and the person. The person is cut out locally with `npx hyperframes remove-background` ONLY for the windows of those cards (~13 s of work per second of video, cached in `<reel>/cutouts`, so re-renders don't redo it). On the page it's the «За мною» checkbox. Use it where it reads better, not on every card.
      - **`bigtext` card:** huge words in the head font (`{"type": "bigtext", "text": "big / words", "y": 330}`, "/" breaks lines), usually with `"behind": true` so they sit behind the head. Fields in the header of `scripts/build_reel.py`. Transparent PNGs (their elements) go in without a frame.
      - Mix the kinds: website shots, a colour block, a list card (`"glass": true` for liquid glass), a sticker from their assets, a `follow` card for the big moment, a counter or chart when they say a number.
   4. **Before the first render, always:** `python3 scripts/precheck.py <folder>`. It hears `master.mp4` again, re-times captions/cards/punch-ins to it, and lists every JOIN (read each: no clipped, doubled or stray word), MISSING speech with no caption, and CHECK words the caption has wrong (misheard words: fix the spelling to what they said). Fix all of it in `edit.json` (a bad join: edl + snap_joins + cut, then precheck again) so the draft they see is already right. A render takes ~6 min: never render to find these.
   5. `REEL_PREVIEW=1 bash scripts/render.sh <folder>` for the draft (1080p, low priority) → `final.mp4` + stage timings. **When `brand.json` "resolution" is 1080x1920, this draft IS the final**: once they approve it, QA and deliver it as is, never render it again. Only a 4K brand needs `bash scripts/render.sh <folder> --final` after approval. Target: one render per reel (plus one per round of graphic changes).
   6. **When a render finishes, send a phone notification** (`PushNotification`; run a tool search for it first, it is usually deferred): reel name + what to check. `render.sh` only shows a Windows notification, and they may be away from the screen.
   Do **not** hand-write composition HTML or use other HyperFrames workflows here: they are slower and ignore the brand template. Exception: own motion design on a phrase or sentence (see "Own motion design on phrases" below) goes in as a `custom` card.
6. **QA** - `python3 scripts/qa.py <folder>` (loudness, size, length, missing words). Then grab a frame at every card and look: text inside the frame, readable over the background, on brand. Fix `edit.json` and re-run render.sh until it passes.
7. **Deliver** - `bash scripts/deliver.sh <final.mp4> "<clear name>"` → upload-ready MP4 in their delivery folder.
   **Covers:** then `python3 scripts/cover.py <reel> ["hook / text"]` → `cover_1.jpg`..`cover_3.jpg` + `covers.jpg` side by side: the sharpest camera frames from three parts of the reel with the approved hook in the brand's head font, text off the face and inside the 4:5 area the profile grid shows. Show `covers.jpg` and let them pick. The hook text is theirs (argument or the title card); never invent it.
8. **CapCut** - `brand.json` `"capcut"`: `true` = always build the CapCut draft; `"ask"` = after delivering the MP4, ask once «Відправити ще в CapCut?» and build it only on a yes; `false` = never. Building it means one extra render with `--capcut` (no captions/sfx baked in), then `references/capcut.md`.

Tell them what changed, and what to check by ear (cuts, names, brand words spelled right).

## Own motion design on phrases
Besides the template cards, the person can ask for their own motion on a phrase or sentence: over the video, or a full-screen takeover that covers them for a few seconds. Offer it in the graphics plan where a line deserves it; they decide.
- Effects, rules and timings: `references/motion-effects.md`. Colours and fonts come ONLY from `~/reels/brand.json` / `brand.md`.
- Build each one as a HyperFrames sub-composition in `<reel>/motion/<name>.html` (1080x1920 unless boxed; own `data-composition-id`, `data-width`, `data-height`; GSAP timeline registered in `window.__timelines["<id>"]`, seek-safe; copy the brand font files and `engine/gsap.min.js` next to it). Use the `hyperframes` skill for authoring.
- Time it on `master_transcript.json` (the cut reel), then add to `edit.json`: `{"type": "custom", "src": "motion/<name>.html", "start": .., "end": .., "layer": "front", "full": true|false, "sfx": "whoosh"}`. Full-screen takeovers set `"full": true` (captions step aside).
- Text behind the head / card behind the person: set `"behind": true` on the card (see «За мною» in step 5.3); the cutout runs only on those windows and is cached. Say it adds a few minutes before the first render with it.
- Before the draft, grab a frame at the peak of every custom motion and check it.

## Connecting ElevenLabs Scribe (required, once)
Scribe gives exact word timing and hears "е/ем"; under 2 cents a reel ($0.22 per hour of audio, ElevenAPI tab → Add credits; keep Auto Top Up off).
1. They create a key at elevenlabs.io → Developers → API Keys → Create: Restrict Key on, only **Speech to Text = Access**, everything else No Access. The real key starts with `sk_` and is shown once (the key ID is not the key).
2. Never ask them to paste it in chat. Open the masked Windows dialog, which writes it straight to `~/.config/reels/.env` and prints only its length:
   `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$(cygpath -m scripts/ask_key.ps1)"` (a Windows sign-in style window: they paste the key into the password field and press OK). `SAVED` = done; `NOT A KEY` = they pasted the key ID, ask for the `sk_` key; `CANCELLED` = ask again.
3. Test it on 20 s of audio with `scripts/transcribe.py` (it should say "transcribed with ElevenLabs"). A bad key stops transcription with a clear message: fix the key or the balance, never work around it.

## Language
`brand.json` "language" (e.g. `"uk"`) drives transcription, filler words and QA. Talk to the person in their language. The Reel Review page UI is in Ukrainian: write every `kind` and `what` in proposal.json in Ukrainian too, and treat «збери чернетку» as "build preview" and «фінал» as "final".
Transcription is ElevenLabs Scribe for every language; fillers are hesitation sounds only (е, ем, ммм, хм; "ну" only on tight/fast pacing).

## Their brand rules win

If the brand file and your taste disagree, the brand file wins. If they correct something during an edit ("no, never outline captions"), add it to `brand.md` under "Rules" straight away so the next edit gets it right.

## Common mistakes

| Mistake | Instead |
|---|---|
| Editing before a brand file exists | Run the setup interview |
| Cutting on transcript word times blindly | `snap_joins.py` before `cut.py`, then read the JOIN lines from `precheck.py` |
| Finding wrong words or late captions on the draft or final | `precheck.py` before the first render; one draft + one final is the target |
| Graphics that decorate instead of illustrate | Each card shows what this exact line says |
| Captions in a font the brand file bans | Re-read brand.md "Rules" before step 5 |
| Saying CapCut works everywhere | It doesn't (see capcut.md). The MP4 route always works |
| Fixing QA failures by lowering the bar | Fix the edit, re-run QA |
